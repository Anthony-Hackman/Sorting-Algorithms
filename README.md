![Java](https://img.shields.io/badge/java-%23ED8B00.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=openjdk&logoColor=white)

This project implements four sorting algorithms that sort an array of strings in reverse order and count the number of comparisons made during the sorting process.

## Implemented Sorting Algorithms

- `BubbleReverseSort`: Implements the bubble sort algorithm in reverse order.
- `SelectionReverseSort`: Implements the selection sort algorithm in reverse order.
- `MergeReverseSort`: Implements the merge sort algorithm in reverse order.
- `QuickReverseSort`: Implements the quicksort algorithm in reverse order.

Each algorithm has a corresponding test class located in the `src/test/` directory.
